                  Insecure is the optional flag to skip TLS verification. Nutanix Prism
                  Central installation by default ships with a self-signed certificate
                  that will fail TLS verification because the certificate is not issued by
                  a public CA and does not have the IP SANs with the Prism Central endpoint.
                  To accommodate the scenario where the user has not changed the default
                  Certificate that ships with Prism Central, we allow the user to skip TLS
                  verification. This is not recommended for production use.
