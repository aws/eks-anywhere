                description: Insecure is the optional flag to skip TLS verification.
                  Nutanix Prism Central installation by default ships with a self-signed
                  certificate that will fail TLS verification because the certificate
                  is not issued by a public CA and does not have the IP SANs with
                  the Prism Central endpoint. To accommodate the scenario where the
                  user has not changed the default Certificate that ships with Prism
                  Central, we allow the user to skip TLS verification. This is not
                  recommended for production use.
