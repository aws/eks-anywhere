                  Nutanix Prism installs by default ship with a self-signed certificate
                  that will fail TLS verification because of two reasons: 1. The certificate
                  is not issued by a public CA 2. The certificate does not have the
                  IP SANs for the Prism Central endpoint \n To accommodate for the
                  scenario where the user has not changed the default Certificate
                  that ships with Prism Central, we allow the user to skip TLS verification.
                  This is not recommended for production use as skipping TLS verification
                  opens up the user to potential MITM attacks."
