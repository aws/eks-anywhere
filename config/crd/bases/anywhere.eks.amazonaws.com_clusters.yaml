                        the current situation and act accordingly. The Severity field
                        MUST be set only when Status=False.

                        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources
                        like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be useful
                        (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is
                        important.
