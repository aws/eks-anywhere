## vSphere Provider

The original vSphere provider template was generated with `clusterctl` and modified to support EKS-D. The template
is stored in `pkg/providers/vsphere/config/template.yaml` The original file is stored in
`pkg/providers/vsphere/testdata/original_077.yaml` so it can be used to compare against the files generated with
 future versions of CAPV.

You may use the `generate.sh` script to generate a new template using `clusterctl`.
