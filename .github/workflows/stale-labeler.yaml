# Stale labeler for PRs and issues

# This action will: 
# * Add a label "stale" on issues and PRs after STALE_DAYS of inactivity and comment on them if they also have the "external" label
# * Close the stale issues and pull requests after 7 days of inactivity
# * If an update/comment occur on stale issues or pull requests, the stale label will be removed and the timer will restart if they have the "external" label

# Runs every morning at 1AM: We don't want people having to wait a whole week to get the stale label removed
