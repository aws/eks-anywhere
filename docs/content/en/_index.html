<p>Amazon EKS Anywhere is container management software built by AWS that makes it easier to run and manage Kubernetes on-premises and at the edge. Amazon EKS Anywhere is built on <a href="https://distro.eks.amazonaws.com/">Amazon EKS Distro</a>, which is the same reliable and secure Kubernetes distribution used by  <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)</a> in AWS Cloud.</p> 

<p> Amazon EKS Anywhere simplifies Kubernetes cluster management through the automation of undifferentiated heavy lifting such as infrastructure setup and Kubernetes cluster lifecycle operations. EKS Anywhere supports many different types of infrastructure including VMWare vSphere, bare metal, Nutanix, Apache CloudStack, and AWS Snow.</p>
