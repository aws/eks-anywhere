Amazon EKS Anywhere is an open-source deployment option for Amazon EKS that allows customers to create and operate Kubernetes clusters on-premises, with optional support offered by AWS.
EKS Anywhere supports VMware vSphere as the first deployment target, with others coming in the near future, including bare metal coming in 2022.

{{< blocks/feature title="Consistent and Reliable" image="/images/network.svg" order="left" >}}
Amazon EKS Anywhere gives you on-premises Kubernetes operational tooling that’s consistent with Amazon EKS. It builds on the strengths of Amazon EKS Distro and provides open-source software that’s up-to-date and patched, so you can have a Kubernetes environment on-premises that is more reliable than self-managed Kubernetes offerings.
