<p>Amazon EKS Anywhere is container management software built by AWS that makes it easier to run and manage Kubernetes on-premises and at the edge. Amazon EKS Anywhere is built on <a href="https://distro.eks.amazonaws.com/">Amazon EKS Distro</a>, which is the same reliable and secure Kubernetes distribution used by  <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)</a> in AWS Cloud.</p> 

<p>Amazon EKS Anywhere simplifies Kubernetes cluster management through the automation of infrastructure setup and Kubernetes cluster lifecycle operations. Amazon EKS Anywhere supports different types of infrastructure including VMWare vSphere, Bare Metal, Nutanix, Apache CloudStack, and AWS Snow.</p>

<p>Amazon EKS Anywhere is a user-managed solution, where Kubernetes cluster lifecycle operations such as upgrades, patching, and scaling are user responsibility. Amazon EKS Anywhere is a fit for isolated and air-gapped environments and for users who prefer to manage their own Kubernetes clusters. For on-premises or edge environments that have reliable connectivity with an AWS Region, consider using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/hybrid-nodes-overview.html">Amazon EKS Hybrid Nodes</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-outposts.html">Amazon EKS on AWS Outposts</a> to benefit from the AWS-managed EKS control plane and consistent experience with Amazon EKS in AWS Cloud.</p>
