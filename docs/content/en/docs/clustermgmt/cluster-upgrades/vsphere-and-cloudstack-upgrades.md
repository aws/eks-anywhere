### Considerations

- **Upgrades should never be run from ephemeral nodes (short-lived systems that spin up and down on a regular basis). If the EKS Anywhere version is lower than `v0.18.0` and upgrade fails, _you must not delete the KinD bootstrap cluster Docker container_. During an upgrade, the bootstrap cluster contains critical EKS Anywhere components. If it is deleted after a failed upgrade, they cannot be recovered.**
- It is highly recommended to run the `eksctl anywhere upgrade cluster` command with the `--no-timeouts` option when the command is executed through automation. This prevents the CLI from timing out and enables cluster operators to fix issues preventing the upgrade from completing while the process is running. 
- In EKS Anywhere version `v0.13.0`, we introduced the EKS Anywhere cluster lifecycle controller that runs on management clusters and manages workload clusters. The EKS Anywhere lifecycle controller enables you to use Kubernetes API-compatible clients such as `kubectl`, GitOps, or Terraform for managing workload clusters. In this EKS Anywhere version, the EKS Anywhere cluster lifecycle controller rolls out new nodes in workload clusters when management clusters are upgraded. In EKS Anywhere version `v0.16.0`, this behavior was changed such that management clusters can be upgraded separately from workload clusters.
- When running workload cluster upgrades after upgrading a management cluster, a machine rollout may be triggered on workload clusters during the workload cluster upgrade, even if the changes to the workload cluster spec didn't require one (for example scaling down a worker node group).
- Starting with EKS Anywhere `v0.18.0`, the `image`/`template` must include the Kubernetes minor version (`Cluster.Spec.KubernetesVersion` or `Cluster.Spec.WorkerNodeGroupConfiguration[].KubernetesVersion` in the cluster spec). For example, if the Kubernetes version is 1.24, the `image`/`template` must include 1.24, 1_24, 1-24 or 124. If you are upgrading Kubernetes versions, you must have a new image with your target Kubernetes version components.
- If you are running EKS Anywhere on Snow, a new Admin instance is needed when upgrading to new versions of EKS Anywhere. See [Upgrade EKS Anywhere AMIs in Snowball Edge devices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/snowball/latest/developer-guide/CrUD-clusters.html) to upgrade and use a new Admin instance in Snow devices.
- If you are running EKS Anywhere in an airgapped environment, you must download the new artifacts and images prior to initiating the upgrade. Reference the [Airgapped Upgrades page]({{< relref "./airgapped-upgrades" >}}) page for more information.

### Upgrade Version Skew

{{% content "version-skew.md" %}}

### Prepare DHCP IP addresses pool

Please make sure to have sufficient available IP addresses in your DHCP pool to cover the new machines. The number of necessary IPs can be calculated from the machine counts and [maxSurge config]({{< relref "./baremetal-upgrades.md/#upgraderolloutstrategyrollingupdatemaxsurge" >}}). For create operation, each machine needs 1 IP. For upgrade operation, control plane and workers need just 1 extra IP (total, not per node) due to rolling upgrade strategy. Each external etcd machine needs 1 extra IP address (ex: 3 etcd nodes would require 3 more IP addresses) because EKS Anywhere needs to create all the new etcd machines before removing any old ones. You will also need additional IPs to be equal to the number used for maxSurge. After calculating the required IPs, please make sure your environment has enough available IPs before performing the upgrade operation.

* Example 1, to create a cluster with 3 control plane node, 2 worker nodes and 3 stacked etcd, you will need at least 5 (3+2+0, as stacked etcd is deployed as part of the control plane nodes) available IPs. To upgrade the same cluster with default maxSurge (0), you will need 1 (1+0+0) additional available IPs.
* Example 2, to create a cluster with 1 control plane node, 2 worker nodes and 3 unstacked (external) etcd nodes, you will need at least 6 (1+2+3) available IPs. To upgrade the same cluster with default maxSurge (0), you will need at least 4 (1+3+0) additional available IPs.
* Example 3, to upgrade a cluster with 1 control plane node, 2 worker nodes and 3 unstacked (external) etcd nodes, with maxSurge set to 2, you will need at least 6 (1+3+2) additional available IPs.

### Check upgrade components
Before you perform an upgrade, check the current and new versions of components that are ready to upgrade by typing:

**Management Cluster**

```bash
eksctl anywhere upgrade plan cluster -f mgmt-cluster.yaml
```

**Workload Cluster**

```bash
eksctl anywhere upgrade plan cluster -f workload-cluster.yaml --kubeconfig mgmt/mgmt-eks-a-cluster.kubeconfig
```

The output should appear similar to the following:

```
Checking new release availability...

```
To the format output in json, add `-o json` to the end of the command line.

### Performing a cluster upgrade

To perform a cluster upgrade you can modify your cluster specification `kubernetesVersion` field to the desired version.

As an example, to upgrade a cluster with version 1.26 to 1.27 you would change your spec

```
apiVersion: anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/v1alpha1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: dev
spec:
  controlPlaneConfiguration:
    count: 1
    endpoint:
      host: "198.18.99.49"
    machineGroupRef:
      kind: VSphereMachineConfig
      name: dev
      ...
  kubernetesVersion: "1.27"
      ...
```

>**_NOTE:_** If you have a custom machine image for your nodes you may also need to update your `vsphereMachineConfig` with a new `template`. Refer to [vSphere Artifacts]({{< relref "../../osmgmt/artifacts/#vsphere-artifacts" >}}) to build a new OVA template.

and then you will run the [upgrade cluster command]({{< relref "vsphere-and-cloudstack-upgrades/#upgrade-cluster-command" >}}).

#### Upgrade cluster command

* **kubectl CLI**: The cluster lifecycle feature lets you use `kubectl` to talk to the Kubernetes API to upgrade an EKS Anywhere cluster. For example, to use `kubectl` to upgrade a management or workload cluster, you can run:
   ```bash
   # Upgrade a management cluster with cluster name "mgmt"
   kubectl apply -f mgmt-cluster.yaml --kubeconfig mgmt/mgmt-eks-a-cluster.kubeconfig

  # Upgrade a workload cluster with cluster name "eksa-w01"
   kubectl apply -f eksa-w01-cluster.yaml --kubeconfig mgmt/mgmt-eks-a-cluster.kubeconfig
   ```
 
    To check the state of a cluster managed with the cluster lifecyle feature, use `kubectl` to show the cluster object with its status.
    
    The `status` field on the cluster object field holds information about the current state of the cluster.

    ```
    kubectl get clusters w01 -o yaml
    ```

    The cluster has been fully upgraded once the status of the `Ready` condition is marked `True`.
    See the [cluster status]({{< relref "../cluster-status" >}}) guide for more information.
  
* **GitOps**: See [Manage separate workload clusters with GitOps]({{< relref "../cluster-flux.md#manage-separate-workload-clusters-using-gitops" >}})

* **Terraform**: See [Manage separate workload clusters with Terraform]({{< relref "../cluster-terraform.md#manage-separate-workload-clusters-using-terraform" >}})

{{% alert title="Important" color="warning" %}}

**For kubectl, GitOps and Terraform**

If you want to update the [registry mirror]({{< relref "../../getting-started/optional/registrymirror" >}}) credential with `kubectl`, GitOps or Terraform, you need to update the `registry-credentials` secret in the `eksa-system` namespace of your management cluster. For example with `kubectl`, you can run:

```bash
kubectl edit secret -n eksa-system registry-credentials --kubeconfig mgmt/mgmt-eks-a-cluster.kubeconfig
```

Replace username and password fields with the base64-encoded values of your new username and password. You can encode the values using the `echo` command, for example:

```bash
echo -n 'newusername' | base64
echo -n 'newpassword' | base64
```

{{% /alert %}}

* **eksctl CLI**: To upgrade an EKS Anywhere cluster with `eksctl`, run:

  ```bash
  # Upgrade a management cluster with cluster name "mgmt"
   eksctl anywhere upgrade cluster -f mgmt-cluster.yaml

  # Upgrade a workload cluster with cluster name "eksa-w01"
   eksctl anywhere upgrade cluster -f eksa-w01-cluster.yaml --kubeconfig mgmt/mgmt-eks-a-cluster.kubeconfig
  ```
  As noted earlier, adding the `--kubeconfig` option tells `eksctl` to use the management cluster identified by that kubeconfig file to upgrade a different workload cluster.

  This will upgrade the cluster specification (if specified), upgrade the core components to the latest available versions and apply the changes using the provisioner controllers.

```

Starting in EKS Anywhere v0.18.0, when upgrading management cluster the CLI depends on the EKS Anywhere Controller to perform the upgrade. In the event an issue occurs and the CLI times out, it may be possible to fix the issue and have the upgrade complete as the EKS Anywhere Controller will continually attempt to complete the upgrade.

During the workload cluster upgrade process, EKS Anywhere pauses the cluster controller reconciliation by adding the paused annotation `anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/paused: true` to the EKS Anywhere cluster, provider datacenterconfig and machineconfig resources, before the components upgrade. After upgrade completes, the annotations are removed so that the cluster controller resumes reconciling the cluster. If the CLI execution is interrupted or times out, the controller won't reconcile changes to the EKS-A objects until these annotations are removed. You can re-run the CLI to restart the upgrade process or remove the annotations manually with `kubectl`.

Though not recommended, you can manually pause the EKS Anywhere cluster controller reconciliation to perform extended maintenance work or interact with Cluster API objects directly. To do it, you can add the paused annotation to the cluster resource:

```bash
kubectl annotate clusters.anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com ${CLUSTER_NAME} -n ${CLUSTER_NAMESPACE} anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/paused=true
```

After finishing the task, make sure you resume the cluster reconciliation by removing the paused annotation, so that EKS Anywhere cluster controller can continue working as expected.

```bash
kubectl annotate clusters.anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com ${CLUSTER_NAME} -n ${CLUSTER_NAMESPACE} anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/paused-
```

>**_NOTE (vSphere only):_** If you are upgrading a vSphere cluster created using EKS Anywhere version prior to `v0.16.0` that has the vSphere CSI Driver installed in it, please refer to the additional steps listed [here]({{< relref "../storage/vsphere-storage#vsphere-csi-driver-cleanup-for-upgrades" >}}) before attempting an upgrade.

### Upgradeable Cluster Attributes
EKS Anywhere `upgrade` supports upgrading more than just the `kubernetesVersion`, 
allowing you to upgrade a number of fields simultaneously with the same procedure.

#### Upgradeable Attributes

`Cluster`:
- `kubernetesVersion`
- `controlPlaneConfiguration.count`
- `controlPlaneConfiguration.machineGroupRef.name`
- `controlPlaneConfiguration.upgradeRolloutStrategy.rollingUpdate.maxSurge`
- `workerNodeGroupConfigurations.count`
- `workerNodeGroupConfigurations.machineGroupRef.name`
- `workerNodeGroupConfigurations.kubernetesVersion` (in case of modular upgrade)
- `workerNodeGroupConfigurations.upgradeRolloutStrategy.rollingUpdate.maxSurge`
- `workerNodeGroupConfigurations.upgradeRolloutStrategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable`
- `externalEtcdConfiguration.machineGroupRef.name`
- `identityProviderRefs` (Only for `kind:OIDCConfig`, `kind:AWSIamConfig` is immutable)
- `gitOpsRef` (Once set, you can't change or delete the field's content later)
- `registryMirrorConfiguration` (for non-authenticated registry mirror)
  - `endpoint`
  - `port` 
  - `caCertContent`
  - `insecureSkipVerify` 

`VSphereMachineConfig`:
- `datastore`
- `diskGiB`
- `folder`
- `memoryMiB`
- `numCPUs`
- `resourcePool`
- `template`
- `users`

`NutanixMachineConfig`:
- `vcpusPerSocket`
- `vcpuSockets`

- `physicalNetworkConnector`
- `sshKeyName`
- `devices`
- `containersVolume`
- `osFamily`
- `network`

`CloudStackDatacenterConfig`:

`CloudStackMachineConfig`:
- `template`
- `computeOffering`
- `diskOffering`
- `userCustomDetails`
- `symlinks`
- `users`

`OIDCConfig`:

- `issuerUrl`
- `requiredClaims.claim`
- `requiredClaims.value`
- `usernameClaim`
- `usernamePrefix`

`AWSIamConfig`:
- `mapRoles`
- `mapUsers`

EKS Anywhere `upgrade` also supports adding more worker node groups post-creation.
To add more worker node groups, modify your cluster config file to define the additional group(s).
Example:
```
apiVersion: anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/v1alpha1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: dev
spec:
  controlPlaneConfiguration:
     ...
  workerNodeGroupConfigurations:
  - count: 2
    machineGroupRef:
      kind: VSphereMachineConfig
      name: my-cluster-machines
    name: md-0
  - count: 2
    machineGroupRef:
      kind: VSphereMachineConfig
      name: my-cluster-machines
    name: md-1
      ...
```

Worker node groups can use the same machineGroupRef as previous groups, or you can define a new machine configuration for your new group.

#### Advanced configuration for rolling upgrade

EKS Anywhere allows an optional configuration to customize the behavior of upgrades. 

It allows the specification of 
Two parameters that control the desired behavior of rolling upgrades: 
* maxSurge - The maximum number of machines that can be scheduled above the desired number of machines. When not specified, the current CAPI default of 1 is used.
* maxUnavailable - The maximum number of machines that can be unavailable during the upgrade. When not specified, the current CAPI default of 0 is used.

Example configuration:

```bash
upgradeRolloutStrategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxSurge: 1
    maxUnavailable: 0    # only configurable for worker nodes
```

'upgradeRolloutStrategy' configuration can be specified separately for control plane and for each worker node group. This template contains an example for control plane under the 'controlPlaneConfiguration' section and for worker node group under 'workerNodeGroupConfigurations':

```bash
apiVersion: anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/v1alpha1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: my-cluster-name
spec:
  controlPlaneConfiguration:
    count: 1
    endpoint:
      host: "xx.xx.xx.xx"
    machineGroupRef:
      kind: VSphereMachineConfig
      name: my-cluster-name-cp
    upgradeRolloutStrategy:
      type: RollingUpdate
      rollingUpdate:
        maxSurge: 1 
  workerNodeGroupConfigurations:
  - count: 2
    machineGroupRef:
      kind: VSphereMachineConfig
      name: my-cluster-name 
    name: md-0
    upgradeRolloutStrategy:
      type: RollingUpdate
      rollingUpdate:
        maxSurge: 1
        maxUnavailable: 0

---
...
```

#### upgradeRolloutStrategy
Configuration parameters for upgrade strategy.

#### upgradeRolloutStrategy.type
Type of rollout strategy. Currently only `RollingUpdate` is supported.

#### upgradeRolloutStrategy.rollingUpdate
Configuration parameters for customizing rolling upgrade behavior.

#### upgradeRolloutStrategy.rollingUpdate.maxSurge
Default: 1

This can not be 0 if maxUnavailable is 0.

The maximum number of machines that can be scheduled above the desired number of machines. 

Example: When this is set to n, the new worker node group can be scaled up immediately by n when the rolling upgrade starts. Total number of machines in the cluster (old + new) never exceeds (desired number of machines + n). Once scale down happens and old machines are brought down, the new worker node group can be scaled up further ensuring that the total number of machines running at any time does not exceed the desired number of machines + n.

#### upgradeRolloutStrategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable
Default: 0

This can not be 0 if MaxSurge is 0.

The maximum number of machines that can be unavailable during the upgrade.

Example: When this is set to n, the old worker node group can be scaled down by n machines immediately when the rolling upgrade starts. Once new machines are ready, old worker node group can be scaled down further, followed by scaling up the new worker node group, ensuring that the total number of machines unavailable at all times during the upgrade never falls below n.

### Resume upgrade after failure

EKS Anywhere supports re-running the `upgrade` command post-failure as an experimental feature.
If the `upgrade` command fails, the user can manually fix the issue (when applicable) and simply rerun the same command.  At this point, the CLI will skip the completed tasks, restore the state of the operation, and resume the upgrade process.
The completed tasks are stored in the `generated` folder as a file named `<clusterName>-checkpoint.yaml`.

This feature is experimental. To enable this feature, export the following environment variable:<br/>
`export CHECKPOINT_ENABLED=true`

### Troubleshooting

Attempting to upgrade a cluster with more than 1 minor release will result in receiving the following error.

```
✅ validate immutable fields
❌ validation failed    {"validation": "Upgrade preflight validations", "error": "validation failed with 1 errors: WARNING: version difference between upgrade version (1.21) and server version (1.19) do not meet the supported version increment of +1", "remediation": ""}
Error: failed to upgrade cluster: validations failed
```

For more errors you can see the [troubleshooting section]({{< relref "../../troubleshooting" >}}).
