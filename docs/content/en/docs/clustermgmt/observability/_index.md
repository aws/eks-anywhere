Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers comprehensive monitoring, logging, alarming, and dashboard capabilities through Amazon CloudWatch. With CloudWatch, organizations can take advantage of a highly scalable, native AWS observability solution for centralized logging for EKS Anywhere.

CloudWatch Logs delivers enhanced log visibility, independent of the log source. CloudWatch Logs is available for EKS environments, as well as for EKS Anywhere providers such as vSphere, Bare Metal, Snow, CloudStack, and Nutanix. This unified solution ensures a consistent flow of events, seamlessly ordered by time, facilitating ease of analysis and troubleshooting.

The flexibility of CloudWatch Logs enables users to perform queries and sorting based on various dimensions, providing a deep level of granularity in log analysis. Additionally, logs can be grouped using specific fields, allowing for more focused insights and targeted problem-solving.

## Observability in EKS Anywhere
Step through the following content to configure an EKS Anywhere Cluster to scrape metrics and logs and send them to [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/).


1. Create a cluster with IAM Roles for Service Account (IRSA): An IAM role can be associated with a Kubernetes service account. This service account can then provide AWS permissions to the containers in any pod that uses that service account. With this feature, there will be no need to hardcode AWS security credentials as environment variables on your machine. [EKS Anywhere cluster spec for Pod IAM]({{< relref "../../getting-started/optional/irsa/" >}}) gives step-by-step guidance on how achieve this.

1. [Verify cluster health]({{< relref "./cluster-verify" >}}): Describes how to verify an EKS Anywhere cluster is running properly.

1. [Install Fluentbit and Configure an EKS service account to assume an IAM role]({{< relref "./loggingSetup" >}}): Step by step guidance to install Fluentbit and configure an EKS service account to assume an IAM role.

1. [Deploy Test Application]({{< relref "../../workloadmgmt/test-app" >}}): Weâ€™ve created a simple test application for you to verify your cluster is working properly.
