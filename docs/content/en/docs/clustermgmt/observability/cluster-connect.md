  Connect an EKS Anywhere cluster to the EKS console
---

The EKS Connector lets you connect your EKS Anywhere cluster to the EKS console. The connected console displays the EKS Anywhere cluster, its configuration, workloads, and their status.
EKS Connector is a software agent that runs on your EKS Anywhere cluster and registers the cluster with the EKS console

Visit the [EKS Connector documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-connector.html) for details on how to configure and run the EKS Connector.
