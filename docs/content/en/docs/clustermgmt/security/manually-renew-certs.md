  How to rotate certificates for etcd and control plane nodes
---

Certificates for external etcd and control plane nodes expire after 1 year in EKS Anywhere. EKS Anywhere automatically rotates these certificates when new machines are rolled out in the cluster. New machines are rolled out during cluster lifecycle operations such as `upgrade`. If you upgrade your cluster at least once a year, you do not have to manually rotate the cluster certificates. 

This page shows the process for manually rotating certificates if you have not upgraded your cluster in 1 year.

The following table lists the cluster certificate files:

| etcd node             | control plane node       |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| apiserver-etcd-client | apiserver-etcd-client    |
| ca                    | ca                       |
| etcdctl-etcd-client   | front-proxy-ca           |
| peer                  | sa                       |
| server                | etcd/ca.crt              |
|                       | apiserver-kubelet-client |
|                       | apiserver                |
|                       | front-proxy-client       |

You can rotate certificates by following the steps given below. You cannot rotate the `ca` certificate because it is the root certificate. Note that the commands used for Bottlerocket nodes are different than those for Ubuntu and RHEL nodes.

#### External etcd nodes

If your cluster is using external etcd nodes, you need to renew the etcd node certificates first. 

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
You can check for external etcd nodes by running the following command:
```bash
kubectl get etcdadmcluster -A
```
{{% /alert %}}

1. SSH into each etcd node and run the following commands. Etcd automatically detects the new certificates and deprecates its old certificates.

{{< tabpane >}}
{{< tab header="Ubuntu or RHEL" lang="bash" >}}
# backup certs
cd /etc/etcd
sudo cp -r pki pki.bak
sudo rm pki/*
sudo cp pki.bak/ca.* pki

# run certificates join phase to regenerate the deleted certificates
sudo etcdadm join phase certificates http://eks-a-etcd-dumb-url
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab header="Bottlerocket" lang="bash" >}}
# you would be in the admin container when you ssh to the Bottlerocket machine
# open a root shell
sudo sheltie

# pull the image
IMAGE_ID=$(apiclient get | apiclient exec admin jq -r '.settings["host-containers"]["kubeadm-bootstrap"].source')
ctr image pull ${IMAGE_ID}

# backup certs
cd /var/lib/etcd
cp -r pki pki.bak
rm pki/*
cp pki.bak/ca.* pki

# recreate certificates
ctr run \
--mount type=bind,src=/var/lib/etcd/pki,dst=/etc/etcd/pki,options=rbind:rw \
--net-host \
--rm \
${IMAGE_ID} tmp-cert-renew \
/opt/bin/etcdadm join phase certificates http://eks-a-etcd-dumb-url --init-system kubelet
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabpane >}}

2. Verify your etcd node is running correctly

{{< tabpane >}}
{{< tab header="Ubuntu or RHEL" lang="bash" >}}
sudo etcdctl --cacert=/etc/etcd/pki/ca.crt --cert=/etc/etcd/pki/etcdctl-etcd-client.crt --key=/etc/etcd/pki/etcdctl-etcd-client.key member list
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="Bottlerocket" lang="bash" >}}
ETCD_CONTAINER_ID=$(ctr -n k8s.io c ls | grep -w "etcd-io" | cut -d " " -f1)
ctr -n k8s.io t exec -t --exec-id etcd ${ETCD_CONTAINER_ID} etcdctl \
     --cacert=/var/lib/etcd/pki/ca.crt \
     --cert=/var/lib/etcd/pki/server.crt \
     --key=/var/lib/etcd/pki/server.key \
     member list
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabpane >}}

- If the above command fails due to multiple etcd containers existing, then navigate to `/var/log/containers/etcd` and confirm which container was running during the issue timeframe (this container would be the 'stale' container). Delete this older etcd once you have renewed the certs and the new etcd container will be able to enter a functioning state. If you donâ€™t do this, the two etcd containers will stay indefinitely and the etcd will not recover.

3. Repeat the above steps for all etcd nodes.

4. Save the `apiserver-etcd-client` `crt` and `key` file as a Secret from one of the etcd nodes, so the `key` can be picked up by new control plane nodes. You will also need them when renewing the certificates on control plane nodes. See the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configmap-secret/managing-secret-using-config-file/#edit-secret) for details on editing Secrets.
```bash
kubectl edit secret ${cluster-name}-apiserver-etcd-client -n eksa-system
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
For Bottlerocket nodes, the `key` of `apiserver-etcd-client` is `server-etcd.client.crt` instead of `apiserver-etcd-client.crt`.
{{% /alert %}}

#### Control plane nodes
When there are no external etcd nodes, you only need to rotate the certificates for control plane nodes, as etcd certificates are managed by `kubeadm` when there are no external etcd nodes. 

1. SSH into each control plane node and run the following commands.

{{< tabpane >}}
{{< tab header="Ubuntu or RHEL" lang="bash" >}}
sudo kubeadm certs renew all
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="Bottlerocket" lang="bash" >}}
# you would be in the admin container when you ssh to the Bottlerocket machine
# open root shell
sudo sheltie

# pull the image
IMAGE_ID=$(apiclient get | apiclient exec admin jq -r '.settings["host-containers"]["kubeadm-bootstrap"].source')
ctr image pull ${IMAGE_ID}

# renew certs
# you may see missing etcd certs error, which is expected if you have external etcd nodes
ctr run \
--mount type=bind,src=/var/lib/kubeadm,dst=/var/lib/kubeadm,options=rbind:rw \
--mount type=bind,src=/var/lib/kubeadm,dst=/etc/kubernetes,options=rbind:rw \
--rm \
${IMAGE_ID} tmp-cert-renew \
/opt/bin/kubeadm certs renew all
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabpane >}}

2. Verify the certificates have been rotated.

{{< tabpane >}}
{{< tab header="Ubuntu or RHEL" lang="bash" >}}
sudo kubeadm certs check-expiration
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab header="Bottlerocket" lang="bash" >}}
# you may see missing etcd certs error, which is expected if you have external etcd nodes
ctr run \
--mount type=bind,src=/var/lib/kubeadm,dst=/var/lib/kubeadm,options=rbind:rw \
--mount type=bind,src=/var/lib/kubeadm,dst=/etc/kubernetes,options=rbind:rw \
--rm \
${IMAGE_ID} tmp-cert-renew \
/opt/bin/kubeadm certs check-expiration
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabpane >}}

3. If you have external etcd nodes, manually replace the `apiserver-etcd-client.crt` and `apiserver-etcd-client.key` file in `/etc/kubernetes/pki` (or `/var/lib/kubeadm/pki` in Bottlerocket) folder with the files you saved from any etcd node.

4. Restart static control plane pods.

   - **For Ubuntu and RHEL**: temporarily move all manifest files from `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/` and wait for 20 seconds, then move the manifests back to this file location.

   - **For Bottlerocket**: re-enable the static pods:
   ```
   apiclient get | apiclient exec admin jq -r '.settings.kubernetes["static-pods"] | keys[]' | xargs -n 1 -I {} apiclient set settings.kubernetes.static-pods.{}.enabled=false 
   apiclient get | apiclient exec admin jq -r '.settings.kubernetes["static-pods"] | keys[]' | xargs -n 1 -I {} apiclient set settings.kubernetes.static-pods.{}.enabled=true
   ```

   You can verify Pods restarting by running `kubectl` from your Admin machine.

5. Repeat the above steps for all control plane nodes.

You can similarly use the above steps to rotate a single certificate instead of all certificates.

### Kubelet
If `kubeadm certs check-expiration` is happy, but kubectl commands against the cluster fail with `x509: certificate has expired or is not yet valid`, then it's likely that the kubelet certs did not rotate. To rotate them, SSH back into one of the control plane nodes and do the following.

```
# backup certs
cd /var/lib/kubelet
cp -r pki pki.bak
rm pki/*

systemctl restart kubelet
```

### Post Renewal
Once all the certificates are valid, verify the kcp object on the affected cluster(s) is not paused. If it is paused, then this usually indicates an issue with the etcd cluster. Check the logs for pods under the `etcdadm-controller-system` namespace for any errors. 
If the logs indicate an issue with the etcd endpoints, then you need to update `spec.clusterConfiguration.etcd.endpoints` in the cluster's `kubeadmconfig` resource: `kubectl edit kcp -n eksa-system`

Example:
```
etcd:
   external:
     caFile: /var/lib/kubeadm/pki/etcd/ca.crt
      certFile: /var/lib/kubeadm/pki/server-etcd-client.crt
      endpoints:
      - https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:2379
      - https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:2379
      - https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:2379
```
