  How to scale your CloudStack cluster
---

When you are scaling your CloudStack EKS Anywhere cluster, consider the number of nodes you need for your control plane and for your data plane.
In each case you can scale the cluster manually or automatically.

See the [Kubernetes Components](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/) documentation to learn the differences between the control plane and the data plane (worker nodes).

### Manual cluster scaling

>**_NOTE:_** If etcd is running on your control plane (the default configuration) you should scale your control plane in odd numbers (3, 5, 7, and so on).

```
apiVersion: anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: test-cluster
spec:
  controlPlaneConfiguration:
    count: 1     # increase this number to horizontally scale your control plane
...    
  workerNodeGroupsConfiguration:
  - count: 1     # increase this number to horizontally scale your data plane
```

Once you have made configuration updates, you can use `eksctl`, `kubectl`, GitOps, or Terraform specified in the [upgrade cluster command]({{< relref "../cluster-upgrades/vsphere-and-cloudstack-upgrades/#upgrade-cluster-command" >}}) to apply those changes.
If you are adding or removing a node, only the terminated nodes will be affected.

### Autoscaling

EKS Anywhere supports autoscaling of worker node groups using the [Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/) and as a [curated package]({{< relref "../../packages/cluster-autoscaler/" >}}).

See [here]({{< relref "../../getting-started/optional/autoscaling/" >}}) for details on how to configure your cluster spec to autoscale worker node groups for autoscaling.
