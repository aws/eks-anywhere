### Configuring MetalLB in EKS Anywhere package spec

{{% pageinfo %}}
Starting at v0.13.5, keys within each config section start with lowercase. For example:
```
L2Advertisements:
    - IPAddressPools:
        - default
```
Becomes:
```
L2Advertisements:
    - ipAddressPools:
        - default
```
Top-level section names remain capitalized as they represent CRDs:
```
config: |
    IPAddressPools:
    ...
```
{{% /pageinfo %}}

#### Example

| Parameter | Description | Default | Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| IPAddressPools[] | A list of ip address pools. See **IPAddressPool**. | None | False |
| L2Advertisements[] | A list of Layer 2 advertisements. See **L2Advertisement**. | None | False |
| BGPAdvertisements[] | A list of BGP advertisements. See **BGPAdvertisement**. | None | False |
| BGPPeers[] | A list of BGP peers. See **BGPPeer**. | None | False |
|---|---|---|---|
|**IPAddressPool** | A list of IP address ranges over which MetalLB has authority. You can list multiple ranges in a single pool and they will all share the same settings. Each range can be either a CIDR prefix, or an explicit start-end range of IPs.|||
| name | Name for the address pool. | None | True |
| addresses[] | A list of **string** representing CIRD or IP ranges. | None | True |
| autoAssign | AutoAssign flag used to prevent MetalLB from automatic allocation for a pool. | true | False |
|---|---|---|---|
|**L2Advertisement**|L2Advertisement allows MetalLB to advertise the LoadBalancer IPs provided by the selected pools via L2.|||
| ipAddressPools[] | The list of **IPAddressPool** names to advertise. | None | True |
| name | Name for the L2Advertisement. | None | False |
|---|---|---|---|
|**BGPAdvertisement**|BGPAdvertisement allows MetalLB to advertise the IPs coming from the selected ipAddressPools via BGP, setting the parameters of the BGP Advertisement.|||
| aggregationLength | The aggregation-length advertisement option lets you “roll up” the /32s into a larger prefix. Defaults to 32. Works for IPv4 addresses. | 32 | False |
| aggregationLengthV6 | The aggregation-length advertisement option lets you “roll up” the /128s into a larger prefix. Defaults to 128. Works for IPv6 addresses. | 128 | False |
| communities[] | The BGP communities to be associated with the announcement. Each item can be a community of the form 1234:1234 or the name of an alias defined in the Community CRD. | None | False |
| ipAddressPools[] | The list of **IPAddressPool** names to be advertised via BGP. | None | True |
| localPref | The BGP LOCAL_PREF attribute which is used by BGP best path algorithm, Path with higher localpref is preferred over one with lower localpref. | None | False |
| peers[] | List of peer names. Limits the bgppeer to advertise the ips of the selected pools to. When empty, the loadbalancer IP is announced to all the BGPPeers configured. | None | False |
|---|---|---|---|
|**BGPPeer**|Peers for the BGP protocol.|||
| holdTime | Requested BGP hold time, per RFC4271. | None | False |
| keepaliveTime | Requested BGP keepalive time, per RFC4271. | None | False |
| myASN | AS number to use for the local end of the session. | None | True |
| password | Authentication password for routers enforcing TCP MD5 authenticated sessions. | None | False |
| peerASN | AS number to expect from the remote end of the session. | None | True |
| peerAddress | Address to dial when establishing the session. | None | True |
| peerPort | Port to dial when establishing the session. | 179 | False |
| routerID | BGP router ID to advertise to the peer. | None | False |
| sourceAddress | Source address to use when establishing the session. | None | False |
