The following additional optional configuration can also be included:

* [OIDC]({{< relref "optional/oidc.md" >}})
* [Registry Mirror]({{< relref "optional/registrymirror.md" >}})

## Cluster Fields

### name (required)
Name of your cluster `mgmt` in this example.

### clusterNetwork (required)
Specific network configuration for your Kubernetes cluster.

### clusterNetwork.cniConfig (required)
CNI plugin configuration to be used in the cluster. The only supported configuration at the moment is `cilium`.

### clusterNetwork.cniConfig.cilium.policyEnforcementMode
Optionally, you may specify a `policyEnforcementMode` of `default`, `always`, `never`.

### clusterNetwork.pods.cidrBlocks[0] (required)
Subnet used by pods in CIDR notation. Please note that only 1 custom pods CIDR block specification is permitted. This CIDR block should not conflict with the network subnet range selected for the VMs.

### clusterNetwork.services.cidrBlocks[0] (required)
Subnet used by services in CIDR notation. Please note that only 1 custom services CIDR block specification is permitted. This CIDR block should not conflict with the network subnet range selected for the VMs.

### clusterNetwork.dns.resolvConf.path (optional)
Path to the file with a custom DNS resolver configuration.

### controlPlaneConfiguration (required)
Specific control plane configuration for your Kubernetes cluster.

### controlPlaneConfiguration.count (required)
Number of control plane nodes

### controlPlaneConfiguration.machineGroupRef (required)
Refers to the Kubernetes object with Nutanix specific configuration for your nodes. See `NutanixMachineConfig` fields below.

### controlPlaneConfiguration.endpoint.host (required)
A unique IP you want to use for the control plane VM in your EKS Anywhere cluster. Choose an IP in your network range that does not conflict with other VMs.

>**_NOTE:_** This IP should be outside the network DHCP range as it is a floating IP that gets assigned to one of
the control plane nodes for kube-apiserver loadbalancing. Suggestions on how to ensure this IP does not cause issues during cluster 
creation process are [here]({{< relref "../nutanix/nutanix-prereq/#prepare-a-nutanix-environment" >}}).

### workerNodeGroupConfigurations (required)
This takes in a list of node groups that you can define for your workers. You may define one or more worker node groups.

### workerNodeGroupConfigurations.count
Number of worker nodes. Optional if `autoscalingConfiguration` is used, in which case count will default to `autoscalingConfiguration.minCount`.

### workerNodeGroupConfigurations.machineGroupRef (required)
Refers to the Kubernetes object with Nutanix specific configuration for your nodes. See `NutanixMachineConfig` fields below.

### workerNodeGroupConfigurations.name (required)
Name of the worker node group (default: `md-0`)

### workerNodeGroupConfigurations.autoscalingConfiguration.minCount
Minimum number of nodes for this node group’s autoscaling configuration.

### workerNodeGroupConfigurations.autoscalingConfiguration.maxCount
Maximum number of nodes for this node group’s autoscaling configuration.

### datacenterRef
Refers to the Kubernetes object with Nutanix environment specific configuration. See `NutanixDatacenterConfig` fields below.

### kubernetesVersion (required)
The Kubernetes version you want to use for your cluster. Supported values: `1.27`, `1.26`, `1.25`, `1.24`, `1.23`

## NutanixDatacenterConfig Fields

### endpoint (required)
The Prism Central server fully qualified domain name or IP address. If the server IP is used, the PC SSL certificate must have an IP SAN configured.

### port (required) 
The Prism Central server port. (Default: `9440`) 

### credentialRef (required)
Reference to the Kubernetes secret that contains the Prism Central credentials.

### insecure (optional)
Set insecure to `true` if the Prism Central server does not have a valid certificate. This is not recommended for production use cases. (Default: `false`)

### additionalTrustBundle (optional; required if using a self-signed PC SSL certificate)
The PEM encoded CA trust bundle.

The `additionalTrustBundle` needs to be populated with the PEM-encoded x509 certificate of the Root CA that issued the certificate for Prism Central. Suggestions on how to obtain this certificate are [here]({{< relref "../nutanix/nutanix-prereq/#prepare-a-nutanix-environment" >}}).

__Example__:</br>
```yaml
 additionalTrustBundle: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <certificate string>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    <certificate string>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

## NutanixMachineConfig Fields

### cluster
Reference to the Prism Element cluster.

### cluster.type	
Type to identify the Prism Element cluster. (Permitted values: `name` or `uuid`)
 
### cluster.name	
Name of the Prism Element cluster.

### cluster.uuid
UUID of the Prism Element cluster.
 
### image	
Reference to the OS image used for the system disk.
 
### image.type
Type to identify the OS image. (Permitted values: `name` or `uuid`)
 
### image.name (`name` or `UUID` required)
Name of the image
 
### image.uuid (`name` or `UUID` required)
UUID of the image
 
### memorySize
Size of RAM on virtual machines (Default: `4Gi`)

### osFamily (optional)
Operating System on virtual machines. (Permitted values: `ubuntu`)
 
### subnet
Reference to the subnet to be assigned to the VMs.
 
### subnet.name (`name` or `UUID` required)
Name of the subnet.
 
### subnet.type
Type to identify the subnet. (Permitted values: `name` or `uuid`)
 
### subnet.uuid (`name` or `UUID` required)
UUID of the subnet.
 
### systemDiskSize
Amount of storage assigned to the system disk. (Default: `40Gi`)

### users (optional)
The users you want to configure to access your virtual machines. Only one is permitted at this time.

them. The user will be what is defined under name above. For example:

```
ssh -i <private-key-file> <user>@<VM-IP>
```

The default is generating a key in your `$(pwd)/<cluster-name>` folder when not specifying a value
