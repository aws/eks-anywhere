### Specifying CNI Plugin in EKS Anywhere cluster spec

EKS Anywhere currently supports two CNI plugins: Cilium and Kindnet. Only one of them can be selected
for a cluster, and the plugin cannot be changed once the cluster is created.
Up until the 0.7.x releases, the plugin had to be specified using the `cni` field on cluster spec.
Starting with release 0.8, the plugin should be specified using the new `cniConfig` field as follows:

- For selecting Cilium as the CNI plugin:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Cluster
    metadata:
      name: my-cluster-name
    spec:
      clusterNetwork:
        pods:
          cidrBlocks:
          - 192.168.0.0/16
        services:
          cidrBlocks:
          - 10.96.0.0/12
        cniConfig:
          cilium: {}
    ```
    EKS Anywhere selects this as the default plugin when generating a cluster config.

- Or for selecting Kindnetd as the CNI plugin:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Cluster
    metadata:
      name: my-cluster-name
    spec:
      clusterNetwork:
        pods:
          cidrBlocks:
          - 192.168.0.0/16
        services:
          cidrBlocks:
          - 10.96.0.0/12
        cniConfig:
          kindnetd: {}
    ```

> NOTE: EKS Anywhere allows specifying only 1 plugin for a cluster and does not allow switching the plugins
after the cluster is created.

### Policy Configuration options for Cilium plugin

Cilium accepts policy enforcement modes from the users to determine the allowed traffic between pods.
The allowed values for this mode are: `default`, `always` and `never`.
Please refer the official [Cilium documentation](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/policy/intro/) for more details on how each mode affects
the communication within the cluster and choose a mode accordingly.
You can choose to not set this field so that cilium will be launched with the `default` mode.
Starting release 0.8, Cilium's policy enforcement mode can be set through the cluster spec
as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/v1alpha1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: my-cluster-name
spec:
  clusterNetwork:
    pods:
      cidrBlocks:
      - 192.168.0.0/16
    services:
      cidrBlocks:
      - 10.96.0.0/12
    cniConfig:
      cilium: 
        policyEnforcementMode: "always"
```

Please note that if the `always` mode is selected, all communication between pods is blocked unless
NetworkPolicy objects allowing communication are created.
In order to ensure that the cluster gets created successfully, EKS Anywhere will create the required
NetworkPolicy objects for all its core components. But it is up to the user to create the NetworkPolicy
objects needed for the user workloads once the cluster is created.

#### Network policies created by EKS Anywhere for "always" mode

As mentioned above, if Cilium is configured with `policyEnforcementMode` set to `always`,
EKS Anywhere creates NetworkPolicy objects to enable communication between
its core components.  EKS Anywhere will create NetworkPolicy resources in the following namespaces allowing all ingress/egress traffic by default:
- kube-system
- eksa-system
- All core Cluster API namespaces:
    + capi-system
    + capi-kubeadm-bootstrap-system
    + capi-kubeadm-control-plane-system
    + etcdadm-bootstrap-provider-system
    + etcdadm-controller-system
    + cert-manager
- Infrastructure provider's namespace (for instance, capd-system OR capv-system)
- If Gitops is enabled, then the gitops namespace (flux-system by default)

This is the NetworkPolicy that will be created in these namespaces for the cluster:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-all-ingress-egress
  namespace: test
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress:
  - {}
  egress:
  - {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
```

#### Switching the Cilium policy enforcement mode

The policy enforcement mode for Cilium can be changed as a part of cluster upgrade
through the cli upgrade command.
1. Switching to `always` mode: When switching from `default`/`never` to `always` mode,
EKS Anywhere will create the required NetworkPolicy objects for its core components (listed above).
   This will ensure that the cluster gets upgraded successfully. But it is up to the user to create
   the NetworkPolicy objects required for the user workloads.
   
2. Switching from `always` mode: When switching from `always` to `default` mode, EKS Anywhere
will not delete any of the existing NetworkPolicy objects, including the ones required
   for EKS Anywhere components (listed above). The user must delete NetworkPolicy objects as needed.

### Use a custom CNI

EKS Anywhere can be configured to skip EKS Anywhere's default Cilium CNI upgrades via the `skipUpgrade` field. `skipUpgrade` 
can be `true` or `false`. When not set, it defaults to `false`.

When creating a new cluster with `skipUpgrade` enabled, EKS Anywhere Cilium will be installed as it 
is required to successfully provision an EKS Anywhere cluster. 
When the cluster successfully provisions, EKS Anywhere Cilium may be uninstalled and replaced with 
a different CNI.
Subsequent upgrades to the cluster will not attempt to upgrade or re-install EKS Anywhere Cilium.

Once enabled, `skipUpgrade` cannot be disabled.

```yaml
apiVersion: anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/v1alpha1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: my-cluster-name
spec:
  clusterNetwork:
    pods:
      cidrBlocks:
      - 192.168.0.0/16
    services:
      cidrBlocks:
      - 10.96.0.0/12
    cniConfig:
      cilium: 
        skipUpgrade: true
```

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
Clusters created using the Full Lifecycle Controller prior to v0.15 that have removed the EKS Anywhere Cilium CNI must manually populate their `cluster.anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com` object with the following annotation to ensure EKS Anywhere does not attempt to re-install EKS Anywhere Cilium.

```
anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/eksa-cilium: ""
```
{{% /alert %}}

### Node IPs configuration option

Starting with release v0.10, the `node-cidr-mask-size` [flag](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-controller-manager/#options) 
for Kubernetes controller manager (kube-controller-manager) is configurable via the EKS anywhere cluster spec. The `clusterNetwork.nodes` being an optional field, 
is not generated in the EKS Anywhere spec using `generate clusterconfig` command. This block for `nodes` will need to be manually added to the cluster spec under the 
`clusterNetwork` section:

```yaml
  clusterNetwork:
    pods:
      cidrBlocks:
      - 192.168.0.0/16
    services:
      cidrBlocks:
      - 10.96.0.0/12
    cniConfig:
      cilium: {}
    nodes:
      cidrMaskSize: 24
```

If the user does not specify the `clusterNetwork.nodes` field in the cluster yaml spec, the value for this flag defaults to 24 for IPv4. 
Please note that this mask size needs to be greater than the pods CIDR mask size. In the above spec, the pod CIDR mask size is `16`
and the node CIDR mask size is `24`. This ensures the cluster 256 blocks of /24 networks. For example, node1 will get 
192.168.0.0/24, node2 will get 192.168.1.0/24, node3 will get 192.168.2.0/24 and so on. 

To support more than 256 nodes, the cluster CIDR block needs to be large, and the node CIDR mask size needs to be 
small, to support that many IPs. 
For instance, to support 1024 nodes, a user can do any of the following things
- Set the pods cidr blocks to `192.168.0.0/16` and node cidr mask size to 26
- Set the pods cidr blocks to `192.168.0.0/15` and node cidr mask size to 25

Please note that the `node-cidr-mask-size` needs to be large enough to accommodate the number of pods you want to run on each node. 
A size of 24 will give enough IP addresses for about 250 pods per node, however a size of 26 will only give you about 60 IPs.
This is an immutable field, and the value can't be updated once the cluster has been created.
