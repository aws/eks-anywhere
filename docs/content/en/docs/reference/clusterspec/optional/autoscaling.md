## Cluster Autoscaling (Optional)

### Cluster Autoscaler configuration in EKS Anywhere cluster spec

EKS Anywhere supports autoscaling worker node groups using the [Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/)'s `clusterapi` cloudProvider.


- Configure a worker node group to be picked up by a cluster autoscaler deployment by adding a `autoscalingConfiguration` block to the `workerNodeGroupConfiguration`:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Cluster
    metadata:
      name: my-cluster-name
    spec:
      workerNodeGroupConfigurations:
        - autoscalingConfiguration:
            minCount: 1
            maxCount: 5
          machineGroupRef:
            kind: VSphereMachineConfig
            name: worker-machine-a
          name: md-0
        - count: 1
          autoscalingConfiguration:
            minCount: 1
            maxCount: 3
          machineGroupRef:
            kind: VSphereMachineConfig
            name: worker-machine-b
          name: md-1
    ```

Note that if no `count` is specified it will default to the `minCount` value.

EKS Anywhere will automatically apply the following annotations to your MachineDeployment objects:
```
cluster.x-k8s.io/cluster-api-autoscaler-node-group-max-size: <minCount>
cluster.x-k8s.io/cluster-api-autoscaler-node-group-max-size: <maxCount>
```

After deploying the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler from upstream or as a [curated package](../../../../tasks/packages/cluster-autoscaler/), the deployment will pick up your MachineDeployment and scale the nodes as per your min and max count values.

### Cluster Autoscaler Deployment Topologies

The Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler can only scale a single cluster per deployment.

This means that each cluster you want to scale will need its own cluster autoscaler deployment.

The most straightforward way of deploying cluster autoscaler is to deploy it to the management cluster as described [here](../../../../tasks/packages/cluster-autoscaler/#install).

If your deployment topology runs small management clusters though, it is also possible to deploy the cluster autoscaler to a [workload cluster](../../../../tasks/packages/cluster-autoscaler/#installing-cluster-autoscaler-on-workload-cluster).
