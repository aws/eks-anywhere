### IAM Role for Service Account on EKS Anywhere clusters with self-hosted signing keys

IAM Roles for Service Account (IRSA) enables applications running in clusters to authenticate with AWS services using IAM roles. The current solution for leveraging this in EKS Anywhere involves creating your own OIDC provider for the cluster, and hosting your cluster's public service account signing key. The public keys along with the OIDC discovery document should be hosted somewhere that AWS STS can discover it. The steps below assume the keys will be hosted on a publicly accessible S3 bucket. Refer [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/configuring-block-public-access-bucket.html) doc to ensure that the s3 bucket is publicly accessible.

The steps below are based on the [guide for configuring IRSA for DIY Kubernetes,](https://github.com/aws/amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook/blob/master/SELF_HOSTED_SETUP.md) with modifications specific to EKS Anywhere's cluster provisioning workflow. The main modification is the process of generating the keys.json document. As per the original guide, the user has to create the service account signing keys, and then use that to create the keys.json document prior to cluster creation. This order is reversed for EKS Anywhere clusters, so you will create the cluster first, and then retrieve the service account signing key generated by the cluster, and use it to create the keys.json document. The sections below show how to do this in detail.

### Create an OIDC provider and make its discovery document publicly accessible

You must use a single OIDC provider per EKS Anywhere cluster, which is the best practice to prevent a token from one cluster being usable with the API server of another cluster. These steps describe the process of using a S3 bucket to host the OIDC `discovery.json` and `keys.json` documents. You do not have to use S3, as the primary requirement is that AWS STS can access the OIDC documents. If you do use S3, you can have a single bucket or multiple buckets to host the OIDC documents. If you use a single bucket, you can host the OIDC documents in separate paths within the bucket, which can then be used for the `ISSUER_HOSTPATH` in the discovery document for each OIDC provider.

1. Create an S3 bucket to host the public signing keys and OIDC discovery document for your cluster as per [this section.](https://github.com/aws/amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook/blob/master/SELF_HOSTED_SETUP.md#create-an-s3-bucket) Ensure you follow all the steps and save the `$HOSTNAME` and `$ISSUER_HOSTPATH`.

1. Create the OIDC discovery document as follows:

    ```bash
    cat <<EOF > discovery.json
    {
        "issuer": "https://$ISSUER_HOSTPATH",
        "jwks_uri": "https://$ISSUER_HOSTPATH/keys.json",
        "authorization_endpoint": "urn:kubernetes:programmatic_authorization",
        "response_types_supported": [
            "id_token"
        ],
        "subject_types_supported": [
            "public"
        ],
        "id_token_signing_alg_values_supported": [
            "RS256"
        ],
        "claims_supported": [
            "sub",
            "iss"
        ]
    }
    EOF
    ```

1. Upload it to the publicly accessible S3 bucket:
    ```bash
    aws s3 cp --acl public-read ./discovery.json s3://$S3_BUCKET/.well-known/openid-configuration
    ```

1. Create an [OIDC provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html) for your cluster. Set the `Provider URL` to `https://$ISSUER_HOSTPATH`, and audience to `sts.amazonaws.com`.

1. Note down the `Provider` field of OIDC provider after it is created.

1. Assign an IAM role to this OIDC provider. 

	1. From the IAM console, select and click on the OIDC provider created from above, and click on **Assign role** at the top right.
	
	1. Select **Create a new role**.
	
	1. In the **Select type of trusted entity** section, choose Web identity.
	
	1. In the Choose a web identity provider section:
		* For Identity provider, choose the auto selected Identity Provider URL for your cluster.
		* For Audience, choose sts.amazonaws.com.
	
	1. Choose Next: Permissions.
	
	1. In the **Attach Policy** section, select the IAM policy that has the permissions that you want your applications running in the pods to use.
	
	1. Continue with the next sections of adding tags if desired and a suitable name for this role and create the role.
	
	1. Below is a sample trust policy of IAM role for your pods. Remember to replace `Account ID` and `ISSUER_HOSTPATH` with required values.
       ```json
       {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
         {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
           "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:oidc-provider/ISSUER_HOSTPATH"
          },
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
          "Condition": {
           "__doc_comment": "scope the role to the service account (optional)",
           "StringEquals": {
            "ISSUER_HOSTPATH:sub": "system:serviceaccount:default:my-serviceaccount"
           },
           "__doc_comment": "OR scope the role to a namespace (optional)",
           "StringLike": {
            "ISSUER_HOSTPATH/CLUSTER_ID:sub": ["system:serviceaccount:default:*","system:serviceaccount:observability:*"]
           }
          }
         }
        ]
       }
       ```
       
	1. After the role is created, note down the name of this IAM Role as `OIDC_IAM_ROLE`. 

	1. Once the cluster is created, you can create service accounts and grant them this role by editing the trust relationship of this role. You can use `StringLike` condition to add required service accounts, as mentioned in the above sample. Please also refer to section [Configure the trust relationship for the OIDC provider's IAM Role](#configure-the-trust-relationship-for-the-oidc-providers-iam-role).

### Create the EKS Anywhere cluster

1. When creating the EKS Anywhere cluster, you need to configure the kube-apiserver's `service-account-issuer` flag so it can issue and mount projected service account tokens in pods. For this, use the value obtained in the first section for `$ISSUER_HOSTPATH` as the `service-account-issuer`. Configure the kube-apiserver by setting this value through the EKS Anywhere cluster spec as follows:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Cluster
    metadata:
      name: my-cluster-name
    spec:
      podIamConfig:
        serviceAccountIssuer: https://$ISSUER_HOSTPATH
    ```

Set the remaining fields in cluster spec as required and create the cluster using the `eksctl anywhere create cluster` command. 

#### Generate keys.json and make it publicly accessible

1. The cluster provisioning workflow generates a pair of service account signing keys. Retrieve the public signing key generated and used by the cluster, and create a keys.json document containing the public signing key.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aws/amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook
    cd amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook
    kubectl get secret ${CLUSTER_NAME}-sa -n eksa-system -o jsonpath={.data.tls\\.crt} | base64 --decode > ${CLUSTER_NAME}-sa.pub    
    go run ./hack/self-hosted/main.go -key ${CLUSTER_NAME}-sa.pub | jq '.keys += [.keys[0]] | .keys[1].kid = ""' > keys.json
    ```
1. Upload the keys.json document to the s3 bucket.
    ```bash
    aws s3 cp --acl public-read ./keys.json s3://$S3_BUCKET/keys.json
    ```

### Deploy pod identity webhook

After hosting the service account public signing key and OIDC discovery documents, the applications running in pods can start accessing the desired AWS resources, as long as the pod is mounted with the right service account tokens. This part of configuring the pods with the right service account tokens and env vars is automated by the [Amazon Pod Identity Webhook](https://github.com/aws/amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook). Once the webhook is deployed, it mutates any pods launched using service accounts annotated with `eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn`. Follow the steps below to deploy the Amazon EKS Pod Identity Webhook to your cluster:

1. Clone [amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook](https://github.com/aws/amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook) if not done already.

1. Set the $KUBECONFIG env var to the path of the EKS Anywhere cluster.

1. Create `my-service-account.yaml` with `OIDC_IAM_ROLE` and other annotations as mentioned in sample below.
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ServiceAccount
    metadata:
      name: my-serviceaccount
      namespace: default
      annotations:
        # set this with value of OIDC_IAM_ROLE      
        eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/s3-reader"
        # optional: Defaults to "sts.amazonaws.com" if not set
        eks.amazonaws.com/audience: "sts.amazonaws.com"
        # optional: When set to "true", adds AWS_STS_REGIONAL_ENDPOINTS env var
        #   to containers
        eks.amazonaws.com/sts-regional-endpoints: "true"
        # optional: Defaults to 86400 for expirationSeconds if not set
        #   Note: This value can be overwritten if specified in the pod 
        #         annotation as shown in the next step.
        eks.amazonaws.com/token-expiration: "86400"
    ```

1. Run the following command to apply the manifests for the `amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook`. The image used here will be pulled from docker.io. Optionally, the image can be imported into (or proxied through) your private registry. Change the `IMAGE` argument here to your private registry if needed.

    ```bash
    make cluster-up IMAGE=amazon/amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook:latest
    ```

1. Finally, apply the `my-service-account.yaml` file to create your service account.

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f my-service-account.yaml
    ```

1. You can validate IRSA by using test steps mentioned [here]({{< relref "../../packages/adot/adot_amp_amg/#irsa-set-up-test" >}}). Ensure awscli pod is deployed in same namespace of ServiceAccount `pod-identity-webhook`.


### Configure the trust relationship for the OIDC provider's IAM Role

In order to grant certain service accounts access to the desired AWS resources, edit the trust relationship for the OIDC provider's IAM Role (`OIDC_IAM_ROLE`) created in the first section, and add in the desired service accounts.
1. Choose the role in the console to open it for editing.

1. Choose the **Trust relationships** tab, and then choose **Edit trust relationship**.

1. Find the line that looks similar to the following:
    ```
    "$ISSUER_HOSTPATH:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
    ```

1. Change the line to look like the following line. Replace `aud` with `sub` and replace `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE` and `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME` with the name of your Kubernetes service account and the Kubernetes namespace that the account exists in.
    ```
    "$ISSUER_HOSTPATH:sub": "system:serviceaccount:KUBERNETES_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE:KUBERNETES_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME"
    ```
    Below are the one exmaple to allow list your `my-serviceaccount` service account in `default` namespace and all service accounts in `observability` namespace for `us-west-2` region. Remember to replace `Account_ID` and `S3_BUCKET` with   required values.
   	```
   {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::$Account_ID:oidc-provider/s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/$S3_BUCKET"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
            "Condition": {
                "StringLike": {
                    "s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/$S3_BUCKET:sub": [
                        "system:serviceaccount:default:my-serviceaccount",
                        "system:serviceaccount:amazon-cloudwatch:*"
                        ]
                      }
                   }
             }
         ]
    }
   ``` 



1. Refer [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.html) doc for different ways of configuring one or multiple service accounts through the condition operators in the trust relationship.

1. Choose Update Trust Policy to finish.
