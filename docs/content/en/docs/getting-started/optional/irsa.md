### IAM Role for Service Account on EKS Anywhere clusters with self-hosted signing keys

IAM Roles for Service Account (IRSA) enables applications running in clusters to authenticate with AWS services using IAM roles. The current solution for leveraging this in EKS Anywhere involves creating your own OIDC provider for the cluster, and hosting your cluster's public service account signing key. The public keys along with the OIDC discovery document should be hosted somewhere that AWS STS can discover it.

The steps below are based on the [guide for configuring IRSA for DIY Kubernetes,](https://github.com/aws/amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook/blob/master/SELF_HOSTED_SETUP.md) with modifications specific to EKS Anywhere's cluster provisioning workflow. The main modification is the process of generating the keys.json document. As per the original guide, the user has to create the service account signing keys, and then use that to create the keys.json document prior to cluster creation. This order is reversed for EKS Anywhere clusters, so you will create the cluster first, and then retrieve the service account signing key generated by the cluster, and use it to create the keys.json document. The sections below show how to do this in detail.

### Create an OIDC provider and make its discovery document publicly accessible

You must use a single OIDC provider per EKS Anywhere cluster, which is the best practice to prevent a token from one cluster being used with another cluster. These steps describe the process of using a [public S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/configuring-block-public-access-bucket.html) to host the OIDC `discovery.json` and `keys.json` documents.

1. [Create an S3 bucket to host the public signing keys and OIDC discovery document for your cluster](https://github.com/aws/amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook/blob/master/SELF_HOSTED_SETUP.md#create-an-s3-bucket). Make a note of the `$HOSTNAME` and `$ISSUER_HOSTPATH`.

1. Create the OIDC discovery document as follows:

    ```bash
    cat <<EOF > discovery.json
    {
        "issuer": "https://$ISSUER_HOSTPATH",
        "jwks_uri": "https://$ISSUER_HOSTPATH/keys.json",
        "authorization_endpoint": "urn:kubernetes:programmatic_authorization",
        "response_types_supported": [
            "id_token"
        ],
        "subject_types_supported": [
            "public"
        ],
        "id_token_signing_alg_values_supported": [
            "RS256"
        ],
        "claims_supported": [
            "sub",
            "iss"
        ]
    }
    EOF
    ```

1. Upload the `discovery.json` file to the S3 bucket:
    ```bash
    aws s3 cp --acl public-read ./discovery.json s3://$S3_BUCKET/.well-known/openid-configuration
    ```

1. Create an [OIDC provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html) for your cluster. Set the _Provider URL_ to `https://$ISSUER_HOSTPATH` and _Audience_ to `sts.amazonaws.com`.

1. Make a note of the `Provider` field of OIDC provider after it is created.

1. Assign an IAM role to the OIDC provider.

    1. Navigate to the AWS IAM Console.

	1. Click on the OIDC provider.

    1. Click _Assign role_.

	1. Select _Create a new role_.

	1. Select _Web identity_ as the trusted entity.

	1. In the _Web identity_ section:

		* If your _Identity provider_ is not auto selected, select it.
		* Select `sts.amazonaws.com` as the _Audience_.

	1. Click _Next_.

	1. Configure your desired _Permissions poilicies_.

	1. Below is a sample trust policy of IAM role for your pods. Replace `ACCOUNT_ID`, `ISSUER_HOSTPATH`, `NAMESPACE` and `SERVICE_ACCOUNT`.
        _Example: Scoped to a service account_
        ```json
        {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Principal": {
                        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:oidc-provider/ISSUER_HOSTPATH"
                    },
                    "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
                    "Condition": {
                        "StringEquals": {
                            "ISSUER_HOSTPATH:sub": "system:serviceaccount:NAMESPACE:SERVICE_ACCOUNT"
                        },
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
       ```

	1. Create the IAM Role and make a note of the _Role name_.

	1. After the cluster is created you can grant service accounts access to the role by modifying the trust relationship. See the [How to use trust policies with IAM Roles](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-trust-policies-with-iam-roles/) for more information on trust policies. Refer to [Configure the trust relationship for the OIDC provider's IAM Role](#configure-the-trust-relationship-for-the-oidc-providers-iam-role) for a working example.

### Create (or upgrade) the EKS Anywhere cluster

When creating (or upgrading) the EKS Anywhere cluster, you need to configure the kube-apiserver's `service-account-issuer` flag so it can issue and mount projected service account tokens in pods. For this, use the value obtained in the first section for `$ISSUER_HOSTPATH` as the `service-account-issuer`. Configure the kube-apiserver by setting this value through the EKS Anywhere cluster spec:
```yaml
apiVersion: anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/v1alpha1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
    name: my-cluster-name
spec:
    podIamConfig:
        serviceAccountIssuer: https://$ISSUER_HOSTPATH
```

Set the remaining fields in cluster spec as required and create the cluster.

#### Generate keys.json and make it publicly accessible

1. The cluster provisioning workflow generates a pair of service account signing keys. Retrieve the public signing key from the cluster and create a `keys.json` document with the content.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aws/amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook
    cd amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook
    kubectl get secret ${CLUSTER_NAME}-sa -n eksa-system -o jsonpath={.data.tls\\.crt} | base64 --decode > ${CLUSTER_NAME}-sa.pub
    go run ./hack/self-hosted/main.go -key ${CLUSTER_NAME}-sa.pub | jq '.keys += [.keys[0]] | .keys[1].kid = ""' > keys.json
    ```

1. Upload the `keys.json` document to the S3 bucket.
    ```bash
    aws s3 cp --acl public-read ./keys.json s3://$S3_BUCKET/keys.json
    ```

### Deploy pod identity webhook

The [Amazon Pod Identity Webhook](https://github.com/aws/amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook) configures pods with the necessary environment variables and tokens (via file mounts) to interact with AWS services. The webhook will configure any pod associated with a service account that has an `eks-amazonaws.com/role-arn` annotation.

1. Clone [amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook](https://github.com/aws/amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook).

1. Set the $KUBECONFIG environment variable to the path of the EKS Anywhere cluster.

1. Apply the manifests for the `amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook`. The image used here will be pulled from docker.io. Optionally, the image can be imported into (or proxied through) your private registry. Change the `IMAGE` argument here to your private registry if needed.

    ```bash
    make cluster-up IMAGE=amazon/amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook:latest
    ```

1. Create a service account with an `eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn` annotation set to the IAM Role created for the OIDC provider.
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ServiceAccount
    metadata:
      name: my-serviceaccount
      namespace: default
      annotations:
        # set this with value of OIDC_IAM_ROLE
        eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/s3-reader"

        # optional: Defaults to "sts.amazonaws.com" if not set
        eks.amazonaws.com/audience: "sts.amazonaws.com"

        # optional: When set to "true", adds AWS_STS_REGIONAL_ENDPOINTS env var
        #   to containers
        eks.amazonaws.com/sts-regional-endpoints: "true"

        # optional: Defaults to 86400 for expirationSeconds if not set
        #   Note: This value can be overwritten if specified in the pod
        #         annotation as shown in the next step.
        eks.amazonaws.com/token-expiration: "86400"
    ```

1. Finally, apply the `my-service-account.yaml` file to create your service account.

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f my-service-account.yaml
    ```

1. You can validate IRSA by following [IRSA setup and test]({{< relref "../../packages/adot/adot_amp_amg/#irsa-set-up-test" >}}). Ensure the awscli pod is deployed in the same namespace of ServiceAccount `pod-identity-webhook`.


### Configure the trust relationship for the OIDC provider's IAM Role

In order to grant certain service accounts access to the desired AWS resources, edit the trust relationship for the OIDC provider's IAM Role (`OIDC_IAM_ROLE`) created in the first section, and add in the desired service accounts.

1. Choose the role in the console to open it for editing.

1. Choose the **Trust relationships** tab, and then choose **Edit trust relationship**.

1. Find the line that looks similar to the following:
    ```
    "$ISSUER_HOSTPATH:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
    ```

1. Change the line to look like the following line. Replace `aud` with `sub` and replace `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE` and `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME` with the name of your Kubernetes service account and the Kubernetes namespace that the account exists in.
    ```
    "$ISSUER_HOSTPATH:sub": "system:serviceaccount:KUBERNETES_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAMESPACE:KUBERNETES_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME"
    ```
    The allow list example below applies `my-serviceaccount` service account to the `default` namespace and all service accounts to the `observability` namespace for the `us-west-2` region. Remember to replace `Account_ID` and `S3_BUCKET` with the required values.
    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::$Account_ID:oidc-provider/s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/$S3_BUCKET"
                },
                "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
                "Condition": {
                    "StringLike": {
                        "s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/$S3_BUCKET:sub": [
                                "system:serviceaccount:default:my-serviceaccount",
                                "system:serviceaccount:amazon-cloudwatch:*"
                            ]
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ```



1. Refer [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.html) doc for different ways of configuring one or multiple service accounts through the condition operators in the trust relationship.

1. Choose Update Trust Policy to finish.
