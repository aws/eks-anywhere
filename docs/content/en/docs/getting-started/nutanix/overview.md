  Overview of EKS Anywhere cluster creation on Nutanix

## Creating a Nutanix cluster

The following diagram illustrates the cluster creation process for the Nutanix provider.

### Start creating a Nutanix cluster 

![Start creating EKS Anywhere cluster](/images/eksa-nutanix-start.png)

#### 1. Generate a config file for Nutanix

Identify the provider (`--provider nutanix`) and the cluster name in the `eksctl anywhere create clusterconfig` command and direct the output to a cluster config `.yaml` file.

#### 2. Modify the config file

Modify the generated cluster config file to suit your situation.
Details about this config file can be found on the [Nutanix Config]({{< relref "./nutanix-spec/" >}}) page.

#### 3. Launch the cluster creation

After modifying the cluster configuration file, run the `eksctl anywhere cluster create` command, providing the cluster config. 
The verbosity can be increased to see more details on the cluster creation process (-v=9 provides maximum verbosity).

#### 4. Create bootstrap cluster

The cluster creation process starts with creating a temporary Kubernetes bootstrap cluster on the Administrative machine.

First, the cluster creation process runs a series of commands to validate the Nutanix environment:

* Checks that the Nutanix environment is available.
* Authenticates the Nutanix provider to the Nutanix environment using the supplied Prism Central endpoint information and credentials.

For each of the `NutanixMachineConfig` objects, the following validations are performed: 
* Validates the provided resource configuration (CPU, memory, storage)
* Validates the Nutanix subnet
* Validates the Nutanix Prism Element cluster
* Validates the image
* (Optional) Validates the Nutanix project 

If all validations pass, you will see this message:

```
âœ… Nutanix Provider setup is valid
```

During bootstrap cluster creation, the following messages will be shown:

```
Creating new bootstrap cluster
Provider specific pre-capi-install-setup on bootstrap cluster
Installing cluster-api providers on bootstrap cluster
Provider specific post-setup
```

Next, the Nutanix provider will create the machines in the Nutanix environment.

### Continuing cluster creation

The following diagram illustrates the activities that occur next:

![Continue creating EKS Anywhere cluster](/images/eksa-nutanix-continue.png)

#### 1. CAPI management

Cluster API (CAPI) management will orchestrate the creation of the target cluster in the Nutanix environment.

```
Creating new workload cluster
```

#### 2. Create the target cluster nodes

The control plane and worker nodes will be created and configured using the Nutanix provider.

#### 3. Add Cilium networking

Add Cilium as the CNI plugin to use for networking between the cluster services and pods.

```
Installing networking on workload cluster
```

#### 4. Moving cluster management to target cluster

CAPI components are installed on the target cluster. Next, cluster management is moved from the bootstrap cluster to the target cluster.

```
Creating EKS-A namespace
Installing cluster-api providers on workload cluster
Installing EKS-A secrets on workload cluster
Installing resources on management cluster
Moving cluster management from bootstrap to workload cluster
Installing EKS-A custom components (CRD and controller) on workload cluster
Installing EKS-D components on workload cluster
Creating EKS-A CRDs instances on workload cluster
```

#### 4. Saving cluster configuration file

The cluster configuration file is saved. 

```
Writing cluster config file
```

#### 5. Delete bootstrap cluster
The bootstrap cluster is no longer needed and is deleted when the target cluster is up and running:

![Delete EKS Anywhere bootstrap cluster](/images/eksa-delete.png)

The target cluster can now be used as either:

* A standalone cluster (to run workloads) or
* A management cluster (to optionally create one or more workload clusters)

### Creating workload clusters (optional)

The target cluster acts as a management cluster. One or more workload clusters can be managed by this management cluster as described in [Create separate workload clusters]({{< relref "./nutanix-getstarted#create-separate-workload-clusters" >}}):

* Use `eksctl` to generate a cluster config file for the new workload cluster.
* Modify the cluster config with a new cluster name and different Nutanix resources.
* Use `eksctl` to create the new workload cluster from the new cluster config file.
