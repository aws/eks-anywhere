  Create an EKS Anywhere cluster on Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure with AHV
---

EKS Anywhere supports a Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure (NCI) provider for EKS Anywhere deployments.
This document walks you through setting up EKS Anywhere on Nutanix Cloud Infrastructure with AHV in a way that:

* Deploys an initial cluster in your Nutanix environment. That cluster can be used as a self-managed cluster (to run workloads) or a management cluster (to create and manage other clusters)
* Deploys zero or more workload clusters from the management cluster

If your initial cluster is a management cluster, it is intended to stay in place so you can use it later to modify, upgrade, and delete workload clusters.
Using a management cluster makes it faster to provision and delete workload clusters.
It also lets you keep NCI credentials for a set of clusters in one place: on the management cluster.
The alternative is to simply use your initial cluster to run workloads.
See [Cluster topologies]({{< relref "../../concepts/architecture" >}}) for details.

{{% alert title="Important" color="warning" %}}

Creating an EKS Anywhere management cluster is the recommended model.
Separating management features into a separate, persistent management cluster
provides a cleaner model for managing the lifecycle of workload clusters (to create, upgrade, and delete clusters), while workload clusters run user applications.
This approach also reduces provider permissions for workload clusters.

## Prerequisite Checklist

EKS Anywhere needs to:
* Be run on an Admin machine that has certain [machine
requirements]({{< relref "../install" >}}).
* Have certain
[resources from your Nutanix deployment]({{< relref "./nutanix-prereq/_index.md" >}}) available.
* Have some [preparation ]({{< relref "./nutanix-preparation" >}}) done before creating an EKS Anywhere cluster.

Also, see the [Ports and protocols]({{< relref "../ports/" >}}) page for information on ports that need to be accessible from control plane, worker, and Admin machines.

## Steps

The following steps are divided into two sections:

* Create an initial cluster (used as a management or self-managed cluster)
* Create zero or more workload clusters from the management cluster

### Create an initial cluster

Follow these steps to create an EKS Anywhere cluster that can be used either as a management cluster or as a self-managed cluster (for running workloads itself).

0. Optional Configuration

   **Set License Environment Variable**

      Add a license to any cluster for which you want to receive paid support. If you are creating a licensed cluster, set and export the license variable (see [License cluster]({{< relref "/docs/clustermgmt/support/cluster-license" >}}) if you are licensing an existing cluster):

      ```bash
      export EKSA_LICENSE='my-license-here'
      ```

      After you have created your `eksa-mgmt-cluster.yaml` and set your credential environment variables, you will be ready to create the cluster.

   **Configure Curated Packages**

      The Amazon EKS Anywhere Curated Packages are only available to customers with the Amazon EKS Anywhere Enterprise Subscription. To request a free trial, talk to your Amazon representative or connect with one [here](https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/sales-support-eks/). Cluster creation will succeed if authentication is not set up, but some warnings may be genered.  Detailed package configurations can be found [here]({{< relref "../../packages" >}}).

      If you are going to use packages, set up authentication. These credentials should have [limited capabilities]({{< relref "../../packages/prereq#setup-authentication-to-use-curated-packages" >}}):
      ```bash
      export EKSA_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your*access*id"
      export EKSA_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your*secret*key"
      export EKSA_AWS_REGION="us-west-2"  
      ```

1. Generate an initial cluster config (named `mgmt` for this example):
   ```bash
   CLUSTER_NAME=mgmt
   eksctl anywhere generate clusterconfig $CLUSTER_NAME \
      --provider nutanix > eksa-mgmt-cluster.yaml
   ```

1. Modify the initial cluster config (`eksa-mgmt-cluster.yaml`) as follows:

   * Refer to [Nutanix configuration]({{< relref "./nutanix-spec/" >}}) for information on configuring this cluster config for a Nutanix provider.
   * Add [Optional]({{< relref "../optional/" >}}) configuration settings as needed.
   * Create at least three control plane nodes, three worker nodes, and three etcd nodes, to provide high availability and rolling upgrades.

1. Set Credential Environment Variables

   Before you create the initial cluster, you will need to set and export these environment variables for your Nutanix Prism Central user name and password.
Make sure you use single quotes around the values so that your shell does not interpret the values:
   
   ```bash
   export EKSA_NUTANIX_USERNAME='billy'
   export EKSA_NUTANIX_PASSWORD='t0p$ecret'
   ```

   {{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
   If you have a username in the form of `domain_name/user_name`, you must specify it as `user_name@domain_name` to
   avoid errors in cluster creation. For example, `nutanix.local/admin` should be specified as `admin@nutanix.local`.
   {{% /alert %}}

     
1. Create cluster

   ```bash
   eksctl anywhere create cluster \
      -f eksa-mgmt-cluster.yaml \
      # --install-packages packages.yaml \ # uncomment to install curated packages at cluster creation
   ```

1. Once the cluster is created, you can access it with the generated `KUBECONFIG` file in your local directory:

   ```bash
   export KUBECONFIG=${PWD}/${CLUSTER_NAME}/${CLUSTER_NAME}-eks-a-cluster.kubeconfig
   ```
1. Check the cluster nodes:

   To check that the cluster is ready, list the machines to see the control plane, and worker nodes:

   ```bash
   kubectl get machines -n eksa-system
   ```

   Example command output
   ```
      NAME              CLUSTER  NODENAME                                 PROVIDERID       PHASE     AGE   VERSION
      mgmt-4gtt2        mgmt     mgmt-control-plane-1670343878900-2m4ln   nutanix://xxxx   Running   11m   v1.24.7-eks-1-24-4
      mgmt-d42xn        mgmt     mgmt-control-plane-1670343878900-jbfxt   nutanix://xxxx   Running   11m   v1.24.7-eks-1-24-4
      mgmt-md-0-9868m   mgmt     mgmt-md-0-1670343878901-lkmxw            nutanix://xxxx   Running   11m   v1.24.7-eks-1-24-4
      mgmt-md-0-njpk2   mgmt     mgmt-md-0-1670343878901-9clbz            nutanix://xxxx   Running   11m   v1.24.7-eks-1-24-4
      mgmt-md-0-p4gp2   mgmt     mgmt-md-0-1670343878901-mbktx            nutanix://xxxx   Running   11m   v1.24.7-eks-1-24-4
      mgmt-zkwrr        mgmt     mgmt-control-plane-1670343878900-jrdkk   nutanix://xxxx   Running   11m   v1.24.7-eks-1-24-4
   ```

1. Check the initial cluster's CRD:

   To ensure you are looking at the initial cluster, list the cluster CRD to see that the name of its management cluster is itself:

   ```bash
   kubectl get clusters mgmt -o yaml
   ```

   Example command output
   ```
   ...
   kubernetesVersion: "1.28"
   managementCluster:
     name: mgmt
   workerNodeGroupConfigurations:
   ...
   ```

   {{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
   The initial cluster is now ready to deploy workload clusters.
   However, if you just want to use it to run workloads, you can deploy pod workloads directly on the initial cluster without deploying a separate workload cluster and skip the section on running separate workload clusters.
   To make sure the cluster is ready to run workloads, run the test application in the [Deploy test workload section.]({{< relref "../../workloadmgmt/test-app" >}})
   {{% /alert %}}

### Create separate workload clusters

Follow these steps if you want to use your initial cluster to create and manage separate workload clusters.

0. Set License Environment Variable (Optional)

   Add a license to any cluster for which you want to receive paid support. If you are creating a licensed cluster, set and export the license variable (see [License cluster]({{< relref "/docs/clustermgmt/support/cluster-license" >}}) if you are licensing an existing cluster):

   ```bash
   export EKSA_LICENSE='my-license-here'
   ```

1. Generate a workload cluster config:
   ```bash
   CLUSTER_NAME=w01
   eksctl anywhere generate clusterconfig $CLUSTER_NAME \
      --provider nutanix > eksa-w01-cluster.yaml
   ```

   Refer to the initial config described earlier for the required and optional settings.
   Ensure workload cluster object names (`Cluster`, `NutanixDatacenterConfig`, `NutanixMachineConfig`, etc.) are distinct from management cluster object names.

1. Be sure to set the `managementCluster` field to identify the name of the management cluster.

   For example, the management cluster, _mgmt_ is defined for our workload cluster _w01_ as follows:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/v1alpha1
   kind: Cluster
   metadata:
     name: w01
   spec:
     managementCluster:
       name: mgmt
   ```

1. Create a workload cluster

   To create a new workload cluster from your management cluster run this command, identifying:

   * The workload cluster YAML file
   * The initial cluster's kubeconfig (this causes the workload cluster to be managed from the management cluster)

   ```bash
   eksctl anywhere create cluster \
      -f eksa-w01-cluster.yaml  \
      --kubeconfig mgmt/mgmt-eks-a-cluster.kubeconfig \
      # --install-packages packages.yaml \ # uncomment to install curated packages at cluster creation
   ```

   As noted earlier, adding the `--kubeconfig` option tells `eksctl` to use the management cluster identified by that kubeconfig file to create a different workload cluster.

1. Check the workload cluster:

   You can now use the workload cluster as you would any Kubernetes cluster.
   Change your kubeconfig to point to the new workload cluster (for example, `w01`), then run the test application with:

   ```bash
   export CLUSTER_NAME=w01
   export KUBECONFIG=${PWD}/${CLUSTER_NAME}/${CLUSTER_NAME}-eks-a-cluster.kubeconfig
   kubectl apply -f "https://anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/manifests/hello-eks-a.yaml"
   ```

   Verify the test application in the [deploy test application section.]({{< relref "../../workloadmgmt/test-app" >}})

1. Add more workload clusters:

   To add more workload clusters, go through the same steps for creating the initial workload, copying the config file to a new name (such as `eksa-w02-cluster.yaml`), modifying resource names, and running the create cluster command again.

## Next steps:
* See the [Cluster management]({{< relref "../../clustermgmt" >}}) section for more information on common operational tasks like scaling and deleting the cluster.

* See the [Package management]({{< relref "../../packages" >}}) section for more information on post-creation curated packages installation.
