  How to deploy a load balancer controller to expose a workload running in EKS Anywhere
---

While you are free to use any load balancer you like with your EKS Anywhere cluster, AWS currently only supports the MetalLB load balancer.
For information on how to configure a MetalLB curated package for EKS Anywhere, see the [Add MetalLB]({{< relref "../../../tasks/packages/metallb" >}}) page.
