  How to perform a cluster version upgrade
---
EKS-A provides the command `upgrade`, which allows you to `upgrade` various aspects of your EKS-A cluster.
When you run `eksctl anywhere upgrade cluster -f ./cluster.yaml`, EKS-A runs a set of preflight checks to ensure your cluster is ready to be upgraded.
EKS-A then performs the upgrade, modifying your cluster to match the updated specification. 


### Minor Version Upgrades

Kubernetes has minor releases [three times per year](https://kubernetes.io/releases/release/) and EKS Distro follows a similar cadence.
EKS Anywhere will add support for new EKS Distro releases as they are released, and you are advised to upgrade your cluster when possible.

Cluster upgrades are not handled automatically and require administrator action to modify the cluster specification and perform an upgrade.
You are advised to upgrade your clusters in development environments first and verify your workloads and controllers are compatible with the new version.

Cluster upgrades are performed in place using a rolling process (similar to Kubernetes Deployments).
Upgrades can only happen one minor version at a time (e.g. `1.20` -> `1.21`).
Control plane components will be upgraded before worker nodes.

A new VM is created with the new version and then an old VM is removed.
This happens one at a time until all the control plan components have been upgraded.

### Performing a cluster upgrade

To perform a cluster upgrade you need to modify your cluster specification `kubernetesVersion` field to the desired version.

As an example, to upgrade a cluster with version 1.20 to 1.21 you would change your spec

```
apiVersion: anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/v1alpha1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: dev
spec:
  controlPlaneConfiguration:
    count: 1
    endpoint:
      host: "198.18.99.49"
    machineGroupRef:
      kind: VSphereMachineConfig
      name: dev
      ...
  kubernetesVersion: "1.21"
      ...
```

>**_NOTE:_** If you have a custom machine image for your nodes you may also need to update your `vsphereMachineConfig` with a new `template`.

and then you will run the command

```
eksctl anywhere upgrade cluster -f cluster.yaml
```

This will upgrade the cluster specification and apply the changes using the provisioner controllers.

### Upgradeable Cluster Attributes
EKS-A `upgrade` supports upgrading more than just the `kubernetesVersion`, 
allowing you to upgrade a number of fields simultaneously with the same procedure.

#### Upgradeable Attributes

`Cluster`:
- `kubernetesVersion`
- `controlPlaneConfig.count`
- `controlPlaneConfigurations.machineGroupRef.name`
- `workerNodeGroupConfigurations.count`
- `workerNodeGroupConfigurations.machineGroupRef.name`
- `etcdConfiguration.externalConfiguration.machineGroupRef.name`
- `etcdConfiguration.externalConfiguration.count`

`VSphereDatacenterConfig`:
- `datastore`
- `folder`
- `resourcePool`

`VSphereMachineConfig`:
- `diskGiB`
- `numCPUs`
- `memoryMiB`
- `template`

### Troubleshooting

If you attempt to upgrade a cluster more than 1 minor release you will receive the following error.

```
‚úÖ validate immutable fields
‚ùå validation failed    {"validation": "Upgrade preflight validations", "error": "validation failed with 1 errors: WARNING: version difference between upgrade version (1.21) and server version (1.19) do not meet the supported version increment of +1", "remediation": ""}
Error: failed to upgrade cluster: validations failed
```
