  Connect a cluster to the EKS console
---

You can install EKS Connector to connect your EKS-A cluster to AWS EKS.
EKS Connector is a software agent that you can install on the EKS-A cluster that enables the cluster to register with the EKS console.
Once your cluster is connected, you will be able to see the cluster, its configuration, and workloads,
and their status in the EKS console.

Visit [AWS Connector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/aws-connector.html) for details.
