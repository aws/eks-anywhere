  How to add integrations to an EKS-A cluster
---

There are additional integrations you may want to use with your EKS-A cluster.
We cannot provide step by step instructions for all of the options but here are some documentation links that could possibly get you started.

* [Kubernetes storage options](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) on-prem and cloud options to consider for storage
* [Kubernetes ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/)

Third party integrations are also available for some Kubernetes resources.
Hereâ€™s some common integrations that may help in your environment.

* [F5 BIG-IP Ingress](https://clouddocs.f5.com/containers/latest/userguide/what-is.html)
* [Citrix ADC ingress controller](https://developer-docs.citrix.com/projects/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/en/latest/)
* [NetApp Astra storage](https://cloud.netapp.com/astra)
