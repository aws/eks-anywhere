This page contains steps for backing up a cluster by taking an ETCD snapshot, and restoring the cluster from a snapshot.

### Use case

EKS-Anywhere clusters use ETCD as the backing store. Taking a snapshot of ETCD backs up the entire cluster data. This can later be used to restore a cluster back to an earlier state if required. 
ETCD backups can be taken prior to cluster upgrade, so if the upgrade doesn't go as planned, you can restore from the backup.
