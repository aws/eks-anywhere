It builds on the strengths of Amazon EKS Distro and provides open-source software that’s up-to-date and patched, so you can have a Kubernetes environment on-premises that is more reliable than self-managed Kubernetes offerings.

## Use-cases supported by EKS-Anywhere

EKS-Anywhere is suitable for the following use-cases:
